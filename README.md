Privacy Policy for ELI5 Web Page Summarizer Chrome Extension

Effective Date: 5/7/2024

This Privacy Policy describes how the ELI5 Web Page Summarizer Chrome Extension ("the Extension") collects, uses, and protects the information you provide when using the Extension. By installing and using the Extension, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

1. Information Collection
   a. API Key: When you use the Extension for the first time, you will be prompted to enter your Anthropic API key. This API key is necessary to access the Claude 3 Haiku AI model and generate the simplified summaries. Your API key is securely stored locally in your browser's storage and is not transmitted to any third-party servers, except for making requests to the Anthropic API.

   b. Web Page Content: When you click the Extension icon to generate a summary, the Extension accesses the content of the currently active web page. This content is temporarily processed by the Extension and sent to the Anthropic API for summary generation. The Extension does not store or retain any web page content after the summary is generated.

2. Information Usage
   a. API Key: Your Anthropic API key is used solely for making requests to the Anthropic API to generate summaries. It is not used for any other purpose or shared with any third parties.

   b. Web Page Content: The web page content accessed by the Extension is used only for generating the simplified summary. It is not stored, collected, or used for any other purpose.

3. Information Sharing
   a. Anthropic API: When you generate a summary, the Extension sends the web page content along with your API key to the Anthropic API. Anthropic processes this information to generate the summary and returns it to the Extension. Anthropic's use of your information is subject to their own privacy policy, which can be found at [Insert Anthropic's Privacy Policy URL].

   b. Third Parties: The Extension does not share your personal information, API key, or web page content with any other third parties.

4. Data Security
   The Extension takes reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. Your API key is securely stored in your browser's local storage, and the Extension uses secure communication protocols when making requests to the Anthropic API.

5. Data Retention
   The Extension does not retain any personal information or web page content. Your API key is stored locally in your browser and can be removed by uninstalling the Extension or clearing your browser's storage.

6. Children's Privacy
   The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to remove that information from our systems.

7. Changes to the Privacy Policy
   We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates or changes.

8. Contact Us
